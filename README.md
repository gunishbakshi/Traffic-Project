# AI Traffic Prediction 
 
### Basic Project Idea

This project focuses on developing a traffic monitoring system using computer vision techniques to detect cars in real-time. Leveraging the YOLOv3 deep learning model, the system captures video input from a webcam to identify and count vehicles passing through a traffic light. The detection process runs for a configurable duration, and the results are stored in a CSV file for further analysis. This solution can be applied to enhance traffic management, improve urban planning, and support smart city initiatives by providing real-time traffic data and insights.
